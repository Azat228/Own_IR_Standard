2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/transmitt_parallel_0/inst/ir_parallel_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/transmitt_parallel_0/inst/ir_parallel_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/transmitt_parallel_0/inst/ir_parallel_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/transmitt_parallel_0/inst/ir_parallel_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/transmitt_parallel_0/inst/ir_parallel_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/transmitt_parallel_0/inst/ir_parallel_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/transmitt_parallel_0/inst/ir_parallel_reg[6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/transmitt_parallel_0/inst/ir_parallel_reg[7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/transmitt_parallel_0/inst/ir_parallel_reg[8]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/transmitt_parallel_0/inst/ir_parallel_reg[9]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_ask_1_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_ask_1_IBUF_inst/O, design_1_i/clk_ask_1
Related violations: <none>
